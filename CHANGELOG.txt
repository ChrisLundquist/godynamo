----------------

- Bring GoDynamo into conformance with substantial DynamoDB changes rolled out by
  AWS in October 2014. 

- This is a major, breaking change in the GoDynamo package. Caution is warranted,
  and users should expect existing code to require attention. Given the
  amount of code changed, bugs should be anticipated.

- Types from the "endpoint" package are now broken out into their own 
  files in the "types" directory.

- In many cases, value types have been replaced by reference types.

- Numerous other small inconsistencies, errors and issues have been addressed.

- Tests have been updated to match new AWS examples.

- Licensing has been removed from the top of each source file. The BSD license
  is now only a standalone file in the top directory of the repository.

- Note: AWS is advertising convenience functions to transform arbitrary JSON to and
  from Dynamo types in its own SDKs. GoDynamo does not provide similar functionality
  given that these transformations are "lossy" and cannot fully encompass the implied
  types of DynamoDB.

- Add keepalive support for programs that wish to use it. See README for sample use.
  Sample use launches a goroutine that HEADs your default DynamoDB url every five seconds.

- Add support for changing the scheme and port of the DynamoDB url (see sample conf and
  README). (bradclawsie)

- Add support for environment var conf file. (donholly)
