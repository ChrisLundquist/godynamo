----------------

- All endpoints now return []byte instead of string for the response body. This
  reduces some needless type transformations.


October 27, 2014
----------------

- Bring GoDynamo into conformance with substantial DynamoDB changes rolled out by
  AWS in October 2014.

- This is a major, breaking change in the GoDynamo package. Caution is warranted,
  and users should expect existing code to require attention. Given the
  amount of code changed, bugs should be anticipated.

- Types from the "endpoint" package are now broken out into their own
  files in the "types" directory.

- In many cases, value types have been replaced by reference types.

- Numerous other small inconsistencies, errors and issues have been addressed.

- Tests have been updated to match new AWS examples.

- Licensing has been removed from the top of each source file. The BSD license
  is now only a standalone file in the top directory of the repository.

--------------

- Add keepalive support for programs that wish to use it. See README for sample use.
  Sample use launches a goroutine that HEADs your default DynamoDB url every five seconds.

- Add support for changing the scheme and port of the DynamoDB url (see sample conf and
  README). (bradclawsie)

- Add support for environment var conf file. (donholly)


May 2015
--------

- Many users have requested parameterized configurations. It is clear that a global "conf.Vals"
  was not a useful solution for many people. This major update provides support for parameterized
  configurations at all levels of the api, and in all cases, this is the default. No apis have
  been broken - existing methods that assumed a global "conf.Vals" configuration variable will
  simply provide that as a parameter to the new functions, which have a naming scheme of
  "WithConf" (EndpointReq vs. EndpointReqWithConf etc). Your existing code should continue to
  work! If existing code breaks, please file an issue, my goal was to make this a transparent
  upgrade.

- The "tests" directory now has live tests that use the parameterized configuration which you
  can use as examples to mine for code.
